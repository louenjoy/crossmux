# Dictionary

Look up words while reading an EPUB using an offline StarDict dictionary stored on the SD card.

## Supported Format

The reader supports **StarDict** dictionaries. When searching for dictionaries online, look for "StarDict format" or files with `.dict`, `.idx`, and `.ifo` extensions.

A dictionary folder must contain:

- `.idx` — word index (required, **must be uncompressed** — a `.idx.gz` will not work; decompress it on your computer with `gzip -d` first)
- `.dict` or `.dict.dz` — definition data (`.dict.dz` is supported as-is; entries are decompressed on the fly during lookup)
- `.ifo` — metadata (optional)

Not supported: `.syn` synonym files (ignored), dictionaries with 64-bit index offsets (`idxoffsetbits=64` in the `.ifo` — rare, and rejected with an error), and HTML-formatted definitions render as raw markup rather than styled text.

## Setting Up a Dictionary

### Download over Wi-Fi

1. Open **Settings → Reader → Manage Dictionaries** and connect to Wi-Fi.
2. Download or update a dictionary. A single download is enabled automatically; **Update All** preserves the current selection.
3. Use **Settings → Reader → Dictionary** to switch between installed dictionaries, or choose **None** to disable lookups.

Online dictionaries are installed under `/.dictionaries/`. Downloads are verified before the old version is replaced, and interrupted installations are recovered the next time the manager opens. Only folders carrying the manager's `.crossmux-resource` marker can be updated or deleted online.

The content profile selected by the current UI language chooses the CrossMux API
at runtime: China uses `crossmux.cn`, Global uses `crossmux.com`. The UI language
is also sent as the `lang` query parameter. Both regions use
`/api/assets/dictionaries/manifest`; third-party configured URLs are unchanged.

### Copy manually

Copy each dictionary folder to `/dictionaries/` on the SD card, e.g. `/dictionaries/webster/webster.idx` + `webster.dict.dz`. A hidden `/.dictionaries/` folder works too. A manual folder whose name conflicts with an online dictionary is never overwritten by the manager.

The Dictionary setting only appears when at least one usable dictionary folder exists. Folders containing more than one dictionary (multiple `.idx` stems) are skipped as ambiguous.

## Looking Up a Word

Two ways to start a lookup while reading:

- Open the reader menu (**Confirm**) and choose **Look Up**.
- Or set **Settings → Controls → Long-press Menu** to "Dictionary", then hold **Confirm** (~0.4s) on the reading page.

One word on the page becomes highlighted:

1. Use **Left/Right** to move between words in reading order, and the side **Up/Down** buttons to jump between lines.
2. Press **Confirm** to look up the highlighted word.
3. Press **Back** to return to the reader.

On the very first lookup with a dictionary (and again if the dictionary file changes), the reader shows *"Indexing may take a while…"* while it builds a small `.qidx` sidecar file next to the `.idx`. Large dictionaries can take longer, and all subsequent lookups use the completed index. The sidecar can be deleted safely at any time — it will simply be rebuilt.

### How Lookup Works

1. **Direct match** — the word is found as-is (case-insensitive) in the dictionary index. Surrounding punctuation is ignored.
2. **Stemming** — on a miss, common English word forms are retried automatically: possessives and plurals (`dogs` → `dog`, `stories` → `story`) and verb endings (`walked` → `walk`, `running` → `run`, `making` → `make`).
3. **Not found** — a short popup appears and you return to word selection.

## The Definition Screen

When a word is found, the definition screen shows the matched headword at the top and the definition text below, with a page counter for long definitions.

- **Left/Right** or side **Up/Down** — previous / next page
- **Back** — return to word selection
