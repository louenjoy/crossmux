# Testing and Debugging

CrossMux runs on real hardware, so debugging usually combines local build checks and on-device logs.

## Local checks

Make sure `clang-format` 21+ is installed and available in `PATH` before running the formatting step.
If needed, see [Getting Started](./getting-started.md).

```sh
./bin/ci-check
```

For documentation-only changes, check local links, anchors, documented commands,
and `git diff --check`. For script or workflow changes, run the focused checks.
Report checks actually run and any hardware verification still needed.

## Flash and monitor

Flash firmware:

```sh
pio run --target upload
```

Open serial monitor:

```sh
pio device monitor
```

Optional enhanced monitor:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py
```

## Useful bug report contents

- Firmware version and build environment
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Serial logs from boot through failure
- Whether the issue reproduces after clearing only the affected book cache;
  back up first, since `/.crosspoint` also holds settings and reading progress
