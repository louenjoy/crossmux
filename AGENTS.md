# CrossMux Development Guide

Project: CrossMux, a community fork of CrossPoint Reader for ESP32 e-ink devices.
Mission: Keep reading fast and reliable while supporting lightweight apps, reading analytics, standby faces, and on-demand services within the hardware budget.
Targets: Xteink X3/X4 share an ESP32-C3 image; ESP32-S3 targets have separate images. See [`scripts/nightly_targets.py`](scripts/nightly_targets.py) for release targets and channels.

## AI Agent Identity and Cognitive Rules

* Role: Senior Embedded Systems Engineer (ESP-IDF/Arduino-ESP32 specialized), preserving CrossMux behavior and the HAL boundary across device targets.
* Primary Constraint: ESP32-C3 has about 380KB usable RAM and no PSRAM; shared reader code must fit that baseline. S3 budgets and capabilities are target-specific. Stability is non-negotiable.
* Evidence-Based Reasoning: Before proposing a change, you MUST cite the specific file path and line numbers that justify the modification.
* Anti-Hallucination: Do not assume the existence of libraries or ESP-IDF functions. If you are unsure of an API's availability for the ESP32-C3 RISC-V target, check the freeink-sdk source or the FreeInk SDK docs (https://freeink.org/llms.txt for an LLM-readable index) first.
* No Unfounded Claims: Do not claim performance gains or memory savings without explaining the technical mechanism (e.g., DRAM vs IRAM usage).
* Resource Justification: You must justify any new heap allocation (new, malloc, std::vector) or explain why a stack/static alternative was rejected.
* Verification: After suggesting a fix, instruct the user on how to verify it (e.g., monitoring heap via Serial or checking a specific cache file).

## Golden Rules — Non-Negotiable Invariants

These are the highest-frequency-violation rules. Each links to the doc with the
full reasoning, examples, and edge cases.

1. **ESP32-C3 sets the shared-code baseline: ~380KB RAM, no PSRAM.** Justify every heap allocation; prefer stack/static; `.reserve()` before `push_back` loops; mark constants `constexpr`. → [hardware-constraints.md](docs/engineering/hardware-constraints.md)
2. **Never bare `new`.** With `-fno-exceptions` a failed `new` calls `abort()`, not `nullptr`. Use `makeUniqueNoThrow<T>()` from `lib/Memory/Memory.h` (or `new (std::nothrow)` only when a C API takes ownership); always null-check and `LOG_ERR` on OOM. → [memory-and-allocation.md](docs/engineering/memory-and-allocation.md)
3. **All user-facing text uses `tr()`.** Never hardcode UI strings (logs may be hardcoded). → [ui-and-input.md](docs/engineering/ui-and-input.md)
4. **Use HAL classes, never the SDK directly** (`Storage`, `HalDisplay`, `HalGPIO`). → [architecture-and-patterns.md](docs/engineering/architecture-and-patterns.md)
5. **No `file.close()` on local `FsFile`** — `DESTRUCTOR_CLOSES_FILE=1` handles scope exit (close member files in `onExit()`, and before delete/reopen). → [build-system.md](docs/engineering/build-system.md)
6. **`memcpy` for unaligned reads.** RISC-V faults on raw `reinterpret_cast` of `uint8_t*` to wider types. ISRs need `IRAM_ATTR`; never call a mutex from an ISR. → [esp32-pitfalls.md](docs/engineering/esp32-pitfalls.md)
7. **Use `MappedInputManager::Button::*` logical buttons**, never raw `HalGPIO::BTN_*` (except in ButtonRemapActivity). → [ui-and-input.md](docs/engineering/ui-and-input.md)
8. **All rendering through the `GUI`/UITheme macro.** Never hardcode 800/480 — use `renderer.getScreenWidth()/getScreenHeight()`. → [ui-and-input.md](docs/engineering/ui-and-input.md)
9. **Free in `onExit()` what you alloc in `onEnter()`.** `vTaskDelete()` tasks before activity destruction; activities are heap-allocated and deleted on exit. → [architecture-and-patterns.md](docs/engineering/architecture-and-patterns.md)
10. **Bump the cache format version BEFORE changing a binary layout** (`book.bin`, `section.bin`); document it in `docs/file-formats.md`. → [cache-management.md](docs/engineering/cache-management.md)
11. **Edit sources, not generated files** (`*.generated.h`, `I18n*` generated headers). → [generated-files.md](docs/engineering/generated-files.md)
12. **Verify repo context before any git op; commit only when explicitly requested.** Unqualified PR requests target `0x1abin/crossmux:main` via `origin` without asking; an explicit user target overrides this default. Do not merge upstream during ordinary tasks. Never stage `.gitignore`d files. → [git-workflow.md](docs/engineering/git-workflow.md)
13. **One physical button gesture causes one action.** Normal Activities read the shared input snapshot; across popups and Activities, gate inherited held buttons and consume the triggering release. → [ui-and-input.md](docs/engineering/ui-and-input.md)
14. **Adjacent interactive controls keep at least 6 px of visible space.** Their hit regions must not overlap, and drawing plus hit-testing must use the same geometry source. → [touch-and-ui.md](docs/contributing/touch-and-ui.md)

## Quick Reference

**Platform detection** (run once per session): `uname -s` → `MINGW64_NT-*` (Windows Git Bash) / `Linux` / `Darwin` (macOS).

**Singletons**:
```cpp
#define SETTINGS CrossPointSettings::getInstance()  // User settings
#define APP_STATE CrossPointState::getInstance()    // Runtime state
#define GUI UITheme::getInstance()                   // Current theme
#define Storage HalStorage::getInstance()            // SD card I/O
#define I18N I18n::getInstance()                     // Internationalization
```

**Core commands**:
```bash
pio run                             # Build (default env)
pio run -t upload                    # Build + flash
pio run -e gh_release                # Unified-language X3/X4 stable firmware
pio run -e simulator -t run_simulator # Desktop X4 simulator (SDL2 + curl)
pio check                           # Static analysis (cppcheck)
./bin/ci-check                      # Full code-change checks (see contributor workflow)
./bin/clang-format-fix               # Format (CI uses clang-format 21+)
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py # Enhanced serial monitor
```

Philosophy: Reading comes first. Lightweight apps, analytics, standby customization, and on-demand services are part of CrossMux. New features must justify RAM, Flash, power, and maintenance costs; use [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) to evaluate them.
