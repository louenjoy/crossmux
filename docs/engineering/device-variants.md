## TL;DR

**There is no X3 build. There is no X4 build. There is one build that is both.**

The same `firmware.bin` runs on X3 and X4. The firmware detects which panel it
is on at boot and adapts at runtime. To "build for X3", build any normal env and
flash it — the device identifies itself:

```bash
pio run -e gh_release        # all 33 UI languages and both content profiles
pio run -t upload            # build + flash to whatever is plugged in
```

All eight ESP32-S3 devices use separate builds because their boards,
displays, input, storage, and power profiles differ from the combined ESP32-C3
image:

```bash
pio run -e x4pro
pio run -e x4c
pio run -e papermono
pio run -e sticky
pio run -e eego_a4
pio run -e murphy_m4
pio run -e waveshare_epaper_397
pio run -e metalio_eink4
```

Seven S3 targets are published by the shared Nightly matrix. X4 Classic has the
same `x4c_nightly` build and Hardware CI coverage, but remains build-only and is
not added to the public Nightly or OTA indexes. Each published target builds
one unified image, which is published under both legacy flavor pointers.
Manual flashing must use the matching build; the embedded
board tag rejects a tagged image for a different board. See
[firmware-release.md](firmware-release.md) for publishing and rollback details.

## Standby-display light sleep

Standby-display light sleep is enabled for the runtime-selected X3/X3 UC8279 and
X4 profiles. The HAL arms GPIO3 plus a timer and consumes the released power
button before returning to the Activity. ESP32-C3 isolates ordinary GPIOs in
light sleep, so the HAL exempts GPIO13 from that isolation: it keeps the X3 SD
rail powered or the X4 battery latch asserted. Display state and all other power
rails remain unchanged.

Repeated timer wake, power-button wake, and button, display, and SD recovery
after wake passed hardware validation on both X3 and X4. X4 sleep current has
not yet been quantified, so no measured power reduction is claimed. All S3
targets remain in the normal downclocked standby loop; a successful build alone
is not a hardware acceptance test.

Bluetooth Page Turner Beta is compiled into every hardware firmware flavor:
development, Nightly, release, RC and slim where those profiles exist. The
runtime setting remains disabled by default; existing saved choices are kept.
Native simulator builds retain the BLE stub.

X3/X4 profiles share `c3_hardware`: internal RAM, a Flash controller and paged
coverage indexes for large SD fonts. The HAL protects the entire C3 BLE host
lifetime from manual 10 MHz idle downclocking. Sticky, X4 Pro, X4 Classic, Paper
Mono, EEGO A4, Murphy M4, Waveshare 3.97 and Metalio E-Ink 4 inherit `s3_ble_psram` through their
hardware profiles, including release/RC flavors. Sticky and EEGO keep their
tuned controller-only cores; USB-capable boards keep the prebuilt TinyUSB graph.
C3 never inherits the S3 allocator or IPC wrapper.

X4 user tests confirm reading/page-turner operation; quantitative endurance and
X3/other-board hardware acceptance remain separate. See
[C3 Bluetooth](c3-bluetooth.md) for configuration, ownership and validation.

The diagnostic PSRAM mode additionally requires 256 KiB free and a 32 KiB
contiguous PSRAM block. Before starting the Host it allocates and immediately
frees a 16-byte probe through the linked NimBLE allocator, rejecting allocation
failure or a non-PSRAM address. It never silently falls back to internal RAM.
`BLE` logs report internal/PSRAM free, historical minimum and largest block at
start, stop, link transitions and every ten seconds while running, plus task
stack high-water marks. Historical minima are since boot, not per-phase peaks.
These are diagnostic safeguards, not a measured production memory budget.

All BLE start callers hold the render lock and use `BleInput` for the memory
gate, at most one recovery, and immediate recheck/start. Bluetooth settings and
key mapping use the same Explicit gate (70 KiB free / 24 KiB largest internal
block); only a rejected gate unloads the SD reading font and clears font caches.
An already-running host neither recovers memory nor initializes again. BLE
synthetic press and release frames both have zero hold duration, independent of
previous physical-key or touch durations.

Reader BLE startup keeps its 80 KiB free / 32 KiB largest internal-block gate.
On a low-memory start attempt, it releases rebuildable font caches under the
render lock and immediately retries without unloading the reading font. If the
gate still fails, it retries after two seconds. Chapter building, Wi-Fi, USB
Drive and sleep still stop BLE; eligible readers restart the host afterwards
and use the SDK's bonded-device reconnection. Hardware reconnection and memory
headroom must be verified on-device, not inferred from a successful build.

The X3-vs-X4 choice is **not** a compile-time decision. Do not add a `-DX3`
build flag or a `[env:...x3]` — see the next section for why.

## Why runtime detection, not a build env

X3 and X4 are the **same SoC** (ESP32-C3, 16 MB flash) with the **same
[partitions.csv](../../partitions.csv)** (dual 6.25 MB OTA app slots). They
differ only in the e-ink panel and a few I²C peripherals — all resolved at
runtime. A compile-time split would:

- double every release artifact (`gh_release` × {x3, x4}) for zero code benefit,
- break the "flash any official release to any device" UX (web flasher, OTA),
- add `#ifdef` branches where today there is one tested code path.

So the codebase uses **100% runtime dispatch** (`if (gpio.deviceIsX3())`,
~268 call sites), never `#ifdef`. Language and content region are runtime
settings; there is no compile-time language SKU — see [chinese-build.md](chinese-build.md).

## How detection works

`HalGPIO::begin()` calls `detectDeviceTypeWithFingerprint()`
([lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp:150-189](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp), run at
[:197](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp)). Three-step resolution:

1. **Manual override** — NVS key `dev_ovr` (`0=auto, 1=X4, 2=X3`). If set,
   it wins immediately. See the caveat below.
2. **Cached result** — NVS key `dev_det`, written the first time detection is
   conclusive. Skips the probe on every later boot.
3. **Active I²C fingerprint** — only on first boot (empty cache).

Both NVS keys live in the `Preferences` namespace `cphw`
([HalGPIO.cpp:118-120](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp)).

The probe runs on the X3 I²C bus (`X3_I2C_SDA=20`, `X3_I2C_SCL=0`, 400 kHz;
[lib/hal/HalGPIO.h:20-23](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.h)) and looks for three
**X3-only** chips ([HalGPIO.cpp:63-113](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp)):

| Chip | Role | I²C addr | Signature check |
|---|---|---|---|
| TI **BQ27220** | fuel gauge | `0x55` | SOC ≤ 100 % **and** voltage 2500–5000 mV |
| **DS3231** | RTC | `0x68` | seconds register is valid BCD |
| QST **QMI8658** | IMU | `0x6B` / `0x6A` | `WHO_AM_I == 0x05` |

Each probe pass scores 0–3. The pass runs **twice**:

- **score ≥ 2 on both passes ⇒ X3** (cached).
- **score == 0 on both passes ⇒ X4** (cached).
- **anything in between ⇒ X4 fallback, _not_ cached** — so an inconclusive
  first boot re-probes next time instead of locking in a guess
  ([HalGPIO.cpp:174-188](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp)).

`DeviceType` enum and the `deviceIsX3()` / `deviceIsX4()` accessors are at
[lib/hal/HalGPIO.h:50-60](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.h).

### The `dev_ovr` manual override — accurate caveat

`dev_ovr` is **read** at boot ([HalGPIO.cpp:153](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp)) but
**no firmware code writes it** — only the auto-detect cache `dev_det` is ever
written ([:178](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp), [:183](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp)).
There is **no settings screen, button combo, or web endpoint** to force a device
type. It is a support/recovery escape hatch you set **externally** (e.g. an
`nvs` partition edit / `esptool`), namespace `cphw`, key `dev_ovr`,
`uint8` value `2` for X3.

To clear a wrong cached detection, **erase NVS** (full chip erase, or wipe the
`nvs` partition) so the probe re-runs on next boot.

## What differs between X3 and X4

| Aspect | X4 | X3 |
|---|---|---|
| Panel | 800 × 480, **SSD1677** | 792 × 528, **UC81xx** |
| Framebuffer | 48000 B | 52272 B |
| Buffer allocation | `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE = 52272` (static, covers both) — [FreeInkDisplay](../../freeink-sdk/libs/display/FreeInkDisplay/include/FreeInkDisplay.h) |
| Geometry switch | default 800×480 | `setDisplayX3()` before `begin()` — [HalDisplay.cpp:39](../../lib/hal/HalDisplay.cpp) |
| Display SPI clock | **20 MHz** (SSD1677 in-spec maximum) | UC81xx profile default, unchanged |
| Battery | ADC on GPIO0 | BQ27220 fuel gauge (I²C) — [HalPowerManager.cpp](../../lib/hal/HalPowerManager.cpp) |
| USB / charge detect | GPIO20 reads HIGH | sign of BQ27220 current — [HalGPIO.cpp:272-287](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.cpp) |
| Clock persistence | ESP system clock; survives deep sleep/reset, not full power loss | ESP system clock plus DS3231 UTC backup — [HalClock.cpp](../../lib/hal/HalClock.cpp) |
| Tilt page-turn | none | QMI8658 gyro, X3-only — [HalTiltSensor.cpp:55](../../lib/hal/HalTiltSensor.cpp) |
| Theme button layout | stacked on the right | up-left / down-right — [BaseTheme.cpp:194](../../src/components/themes/BaseTheme.cpp), [LyraTheme.cpp:399](../../src/components/themes/lyra/LyraTheme.cpp) |
| INX front-button hints | four bottom segments aligned to the X4 keys | four bottom segments using the wider X3 spacing; labels remain orientation-aware — [InxTheme.cpp](../../src/components/themes/inx/InxTheme.cpp) |
| Grayscale / refresh | SSD1677 fast LUT | UC81xx OEM pipeline + "AA-pre-BW" preconditioning — [FreeInkDisplay](../../freeink-sdk/libs/display/FreeInkDisplay/include/FreeInkDisplay.h) |

The application HAL does not override the display bus or refresh waveform.
`HalDisplay::begin()` only selects the X3 panel before the SDK driver starts.
For X4, the SDK's active board profile selects a 20 MHz SPI clock and the stock
absolute FAST sequence (`0xFC`) with its temperature and power sequencing. This
avoids the persistent ghosting observed with the weaker incremental `0x1C`
path. X3 never constructs the SSD1677 driver, and Sticky retains its own
board-specific SSD1677 waveform config.

### Unified system clock and optional RTC

The POSIX/ESP system UTC clock is the runtime source on every device.
`HalClock::begin()` probes the optional external RTC and uses it only to restore
an invalid system clock after power loss. A stopped, unreadable, absent, or
invalid RTC naturally falls back to the same software-clock path; business and
UI code never branch on X3/X4 or RTC availability.

Network and manual updates set the system clock first, then write the UTC value
back to an available RTC. A failed RTC write is logged but does not invalidate
the successfully updated system time. The RTC is not polled periodically while
the device is running.

`clockUtcOffsetQ` remains a fixed display offset used by the status bar and
Standby faces; it does not change the process-wide timezone. Every device exposes
automatic sync, manual date/time, fixed offset, 12/24-hour format, and one-shot
sync under **Settings → System → Date & Time**. First-start Simplified Chinese
defaults to UTC+8 and other languages to UTC+0; upgrades preserve saved values.

The SPI display pins (`EPD_SCLK=8`, `EPD_MOSI=10`, `EPD_CS=21`, `EPD_DC=4`,
`EPD_RST=5`, `EPD_BUSY=6`) and the ADC button layout are **identical** on both
devices ([lib/hal/HalGPIO.h](../../lib/hal/HalGPIO.h)).

All rendering reads geometry from `getScreenWidth()` / `getScreenHeight()`
(never hardcoded 800/480), so layout follows the detected panel automatically —
this is why X3 "just works" without per-screen code (see
[ui-and-input.md](ui-and-input.md), golden rule #8).

## Build & flash for X3

Same envs as X4 (`platformio.ini`): `default`, `gh_release`, `gh_release_rc`,
and `slim`. Flash any of them to an X3:

```bash
pio run -e gh_release -t upload
# or, manual:
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 \
  write_flash 0x10000 .pio/build/gh_release/firmware.bin
```

**Web flasher device target.** The in-firmware file/flash page
([English Files page](../../src/network/html/en/FilesPage.html) and
[Chinese Files page](../../src/network/html/zh-CN/FilesPage.html),
profile `X3: { width: 528, height: 792 }`) exposes an X3/X4 target selector.
That selector drives per-silicon image **patching**
([FirmwareFlasher.h](../../src/network/FirmwareFlasher.h) /
`patch_firmware_image.py`) so the stock bootloader accepts the OTA image — it
does **not** select a different firmware. Pick the target that matches the
physical device.

## Testing X3 without hardware

The pinned desktop simulator fork provides an X3 environment with the 792×528
framebuffer, X3 board profile, and simulated tilt input:

```bash
pio run -e simulator_x3 -t run_simulator
```

Use real X3 hardware for final electrical, sensor, power, and display-waveform
verification.

## Verifying which device you're on

- **Serial** — boot log line `Hardware detect: X3`
  ([src/main.cpp:453](../../src/main.cpp)). The line above it prints the probe
  scores.
- **Web API** — `device` field uses `BoardConfig::ACTIVE.name`
  (`"xteink_x3"` / `"xteink_x4"`)
  ([CrossPointWebServer.cpp:382](../../src/network/CrossPointWebServer.cpp)).
- **UI** — the X3-only Tilt Page Turn item appears only when the QMI8658 is
  detected. Clock and Date & Time settings are available on every device.

## Adding a future device variant

Use the [port-device-bsp skill](../../.agents/skills/port-device-bsp/SKILL.md)
to establish the hardware contract, select an integration path, and record build
and physical acceptance evidence.

X3/X4 retain their shared image. A future runtime variant may share an image only
when silicon, partitions, initialization and reliable device identification are
compatible. Extend detection and panel selection only for that verified case;
do not add every new board to the X3/X4 `DeviceType` enum.

Otherwise add a separate hardware profile and build environment, following the
existing S3 targets in [platformio.ini](../../platformio.ini). Reuse the SDK's
board profiles and controller drivers where supported; keep application access
to peripherals behind the HAL and adapt layout through renderer geometry.
Unsupported chip architectures require a platform/toolchain assessment before
BSP implementation. A successful build is not physical acceptance, and a new
build target does not automatically enter public Nightly or OTA indexes.
