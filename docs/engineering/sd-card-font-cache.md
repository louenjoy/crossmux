# SD-Card Font Cache

The inactive OTA application slot doubles as a disposable cache for one SD-card
reader font. This removes most filesystem and SD-SPI latency from the reader's
initial font load, first-page prewarm, later page prewarms, and on-demand glyph
reads.

The cache holds only the selected reader family and point size. It does not
cache the 8/10/12pt UI fallback fonts, add an LRU, or make an SD font part of
the firmware image. `SdCardFont` still provides the renderer-facing font
interface; only its random-access storage backend changes.

On `BOARD_HAS_PSRAM` targets, the selected reader font also gets a volatile,
1 MiB on-demand glyph cache. The first metadata or bitmap read still comes from
the selected Flash/SD backend; later pages copy the same immutable glyph bytes
from PSRAM into the ordinary internal-DRAM page mini-cache. The PSRAM cache is
released with the font, is never used by UI fallback sizes, and does not change
the persistent cache format. Allocation failure leaves the existing Flash/SD
path unchanged.

On no-PSRAM targets, optional advance-table and page prewarm allocations must
leave 16 KiB free heap and 8 KiB contiguous headroom. Their budgets include
simultaneously live collection, mapping, staging and replacement buffers; old
caches are already charged against the live heap. A rejected prewarm keeps
on-demand font reads available and is not reported as missing glyph coverage.
Page cache growth acquires all replacement buffers before discarding valid data;
temporary mappings remain RAII-owned on every exit. The no-PSRAM preparation
path does not run the PSRAM path's later capacity-growth checks. Its budget
pre-read uses one stack glyph instead of another heap array of glyph metadata.
Between chapter parsing batches, the reader releases rebuildable font caches
when free heap is below 48 KiB or the largest block is below 16 KiB.

The canonical byte layout is documented in
[file-formats.md](../file-formats.md#sd-card-font-cache).

## Partition reuse model

CrossPoint keeps two interchangeable OTA application slots. At any point one
contains the running firmware; `HalOtaSlot::inactive()` selects the other. The
following diagram is one snapshot of those roles, not a fixed assignment:

```text
ESP32 Flash
+-----------------------------------+
| Bootloader / Partition Table      |
+-----------------------------------+
| NVS                               |
+-----------------------------------+
| OTA metadata                      |  cache never writes here
+===================================+
| OTA App Slot A                    |  running firmware
+===================================+
| OTA App Slot B                    |  inactive -> SD font cache
| +-------------------------------+ |
| | Cache header                  | |  Magic/path/size/hash/CRC
| +-------------------------------+ |
| | Current .cpfont payload       | |  bounded random Flash reads
| +-------------------------------+ |
+===================================+
| SPIFFS                            |  not used by this cache
+-----------------------------------+
| Core dump                         |
+-----------------------------------+
```

The cache uses the partition layout as follows:

1. `HalOtaSlot::inactive()` locates the application slot that is not running.
2. `safeForScratchWrite()` permits erasing it only when the running image is
   confirmed or not rollback-tracked; pending and unsafe images are rejected.
3. Preprocessing invalidates the old cache header, writes and verifies the
   `.cpfont` payload, then commits the `CPSDFC1` header and CRC last.
4. `SdCardFont` keeps the same renderer interface while bounded partition reads
   replace SD filesystem reads. A Flash failure retries the same offset on SD.
5. An OTA download overwrites the cache with the new image. After that image is
   confirmed, the former firmware slot becomes inactive and may hold the next
   font cache.

The roles rotate symmetrically in both OTA directions:

```text
Normal boot             First boot after OTA       After confirmation
Slot A: running    ->    Slot A: rollback image ->  Slot A: font cache
Slot B: font cache ->    Slot B: new / pending  ->  Slot B: running
```

`verifyRollbackLater()` prevents Arduino from confirming a pending image before
`setup()`. On the first boot after OTA, the application initializes storage,
settings, the display, the render task, and the font decompressor, then
physically displays the firmware-verification page. Only after that frame
finishes does it mark the running image valid.

Until confirmation succeeds, `safeForScratchWrite()` rejects every cache
write. A reset, crash, watchdog, or power loss before confirmation therefore
still permits bootloader rollback. A power loss while rebuilding after
confirmation leaves the new firmware valid but the cache header invalid, so
the next boot uses SD. Recovery-firmware mode confirms a successfully displayed
new image but skips automatic font rebuilding.

## Why it is faster

An SD font normally pays for SD-SPI transactions, filesystem traversal, and
many seeks while the prewarm code gathers glyph metadata, bitmaps, kerning, and
advance tables. A valid cache preserves the same offset-sorted read algorithm
but serves it with bounded `esp_partition_read()` calls through `HalOtaSlot`.
The font is not memory-mapped, so it does not consume the ESP32-C3's limited
MMU pages.

Startup still opens the SD source long enough to compare its path, size, and
`.cpfont` header/style TOC identity. The large random reads that dominate page
prewarm then come from internal Flash.

```text
SdCardFont
    |
    v
cache header/path/size/TOC valid?
    | yes                         | no
    v                             v
HalOtaSlot bounded random read    HalStorage / SD
    |
    +-- Flash read failure ------> same-offset SD fallback
```

Every Flash read is bounded by the committed payload size, not merely by the
OTA partition capacity. A partition read error disables Flash for that loaded
font and retries the same offset from SD.

## Cache identity and commit

The first 4KiB erase sector contains a versioned `CPSDFC1` header. It records
the source path, payload size, an FNV-1a identity of the `.cpfont` header and
style TOC, the complete payload CRC-32, and a header CRC-32. The current
0x640000-byte OTA slot leaves 6,549,504 bytes for the `.cpfont` payload.

A preload uses the following commit sequence:

1. Reject an unsafe slot, invalid source, or oversized payload.
2. Allocate one fallible, short-lived 4KiB copy buffer.
3. Erase the header sector first, invalidating any previous cache.
4. Erase and copy the payload while calculating its CRC.
5. Read the payload back from Flash and compare the complete CRC.
6. Write the valid header last.

A partial header write is rejected by its Magic/version/header CRC. The normal
boot path validates the header and SD source identity but deliberately does not
rescan the entire payload CRC; doing so would add a full-font read before the
first page. The complete CRC is guaranteed at commit time, while later
Flash-driver read failures fall back to SD. Silent Flash bit rot after a
successful commit is not detected without rebuilding the cache.

The earlier `CPOTAF1` Magic is intentionally rejected. After a direct USB
flash, that legacy cache falls back to SD until the user confirms the font or
changes its point size. A normal OTA overwrites the cache slot and rebuilds it
after the new firmware is confirmed.

## Rebuild triggers and progress

The hidden `sdFontFlashPreload` setting stores the user's preference:

- Font and point-size changes in Text Settings load only the data needed for
  preview from SD; they do not rebuild the cache.
- Leaving standalone Text Settings by Back or Home enables acceleration only
  when the final font family or point size differs from the values on entry. Layout- or
  style-only edits, and font changes restored before exit, keep the previous
  acceleration preference and skip the preprocessing page. The font downloader
  marks its newly selected family as changed before opening Text Settings.
  A matching cache is reused without rewriting Flash. Selecting a built-in font
  disables the preference and exits without a cache write.
- The reader toolbar's Text panel owns one preview session across its font
  picker, size popup, and switches between panels. Its font picker (including
  a nested font download/preview) defers acceleration. Only returning to the
  reading page ends the session: a changed final SD family or point size with
  no valid cache prompts to start acceleration or skip it (the default).
  Back or tapping outside the prompt also skips. The selection remains saved;
  simply reopening the menu does not prompt again. Returning to the toolbar
  alone does not prompt. Home, sleep, and activity destruction never start a
  write. Built-in fonts, layout/style-only changes, and changes restored before
  exit skip the prompt; restored selections retain their original preference.
  A changed selection with a valid cache enables and reloads that cache without
  prompting or writing. Confirmed preloads reuse Text Settings' progress and
  failure UI and return to the same reading position. Touch and physical
  buttons follow the same flow; the classic reader menu is unchanged.
- The Chinese EPUB missing-glyph flow uses the same Text Settings preload path
  in an automatic exit mode. It first requires the `NotoSansSC` manifest to
  contain the reader's exact point size, so `ensureLoaded()` cannot snap the
  setting. It downloads the whole family, saves the selection with preload off,
  and silently restarts before loading it. This avoids asking the Wi-Fi/TLS-
  fragmented heap for the complete CJK font's 48,000-byte contiguous interval
  table. The clean boot loads and caches only the selected size, then returns to
  the same book. A cache failure persists `sdFontFlashPreload=0` and continues
  from SD after one acknowledgement.
- A newly installed OTA image automatically rebuilds once, after successful
  firmware confirmation, when the selected SD font exists and the cache is
  invalid.
- An ordinary boot does not retry a failed post-OTA rebuild. A later final font
  or point-size change in standalone Text Settings, or an accepted reader
  toolbar prompt after such a change, provides the next explicit retry.
  Entering and leaving Text Settings without such a change is not a retry
  trigger. Sleep, power loss, and forced activity destruction do not start a
  write.

To verify the reader prompt, build `ReaderFontPreviewTest` and run:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build/test -R ReaderFontPreview --output-on-failure
```

On a touch device, change an SD font size, return through the toolbar to the page, and decline;
reopening and closing the menu must stay silent. Change again and accept:
the progress page must finish before returning to the same text. Repeat with
physical buttons, a cached size, and changes restored to their original value.
Serial font statistics should report `source=flash` (or `psram+flash`) after a
successful preload or cache reuse, and `source=sd` (or `psram+sd`) after skipping
an uncached selection. Verify actual Flash writes and power-loss recovery on
hardware, not the desktop simulator.

Manual preloads and post-OTA rebuilds share the same storage-neutral
preprocessing page. It shows the selected family and physical point size,
per-pass byte count, total percentage, and power-loss warning without naming
OTA, copying, or verification.

Internally, copying still occupies total progress 0-50% and read-back
verification occupies 50-100%. The page uses fast refreshes at the pass
transition and 10% increments. Both entry points physically complete the
verified 100% frame and the Ready page. Text Settings reloads the final font
afterward so a reader that opened the screen can resume rendering immediately;
post-OTA rebuilds continue to Home without clearing the last-open book or its
reading position.

Automatic sleep and cancellation are disabled during the operation. Failures
are grouped as source too large, OOM, SD read, Flash erase/write, or
verification failure; all continue with the SD font.

During the automatic reader flow, power loss before a font file's verified
rename leaves the previous selection active; `.part` files are never selected.
Power loss after the selection is saved but before the software restart safely
loads the font from SD on the next cold boot and skips automatic preprocessing.
Power loss during preprocessing leaves an invalid cache header, so the selected
font safely loads from SD on the next boot. Failed or cancelled network flows
use a one-shot RTC resume target to avoid reopening the missing-glyph prompt
immediately; a normal cold boot may offer it again.

## Performance verification

An exploratory A/B measurement was run on an X4 with a Chinese SD-card reader
font and EPUB content. One session read the font directly from SD; the other
used the preprocessed internal-Flash cache. Temporary structured timing logs
confirmed `source=sd` and `source=flash` respectively. The SD session supplied
20 render-path prewarm samples and the Flash session supplied 28. Values below
use the median and nearest-rank p95.

| Metric | SD median / p95 | Flash median / p95 | Improvement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Font prewarm | 269 / 538 ms | 17 / 32 ms | 93.7% / 94.1% |
| Font read | 257 / 430 ms | 2 / 21 ms | 99.2% / 95.1% |
| Render-path prewarm | 335 / 548 ms | 20 / 35 ms | 94.0% / 93.6% |

For samples with non-zero I/O, the median per-sample `read_ms / io_ops`
dropped from 1.414 ms per operation to 0.063 ms, a 95.5% reduction. The p95 I/O
counts were nearly unchanged (336 from SD and 332 from Flash), so the gain
comes from lower random-read latency rather than doing less font work.

The observed median book-open time fell from 6,626 ms to 2,907 ms, but this is
not treated as an end-to-end acceptance result. Each mode had only two open
samples, the pages were not matched, and grayscale rendering, allocation
failures, and one interleaved serial line contaminated page-total timing. The
measurement therefore supports the font-read and prewarm speedup only.

Existing debug logs expose the storage source and timing needed to repeat the
comparison:

- `Initial load source=flash|sd load_ms=...`
- `[txt-page] source=psram+flash|psram+sd|flash|sd total=... read_ms=...`
- `First page displayed: open_total=...`
- Page rendering logs report display time separately from font prewarm.

A controlled end-to-end rerun must use the same device, SD card, font, point
size, book, and page range in both modes. Disable text antialiasing, avoid image
pages, collect at least five cold book opens and 30 consecutive text pages per
mode, and keep a fixed dwell time when measuring idle prewarm. Report e-paper
refresh separately: the cache accelerates font I/O, not the physical panel
waveform.

The implementation adds no resident cache buffer, background task, or LRU. Its
only new working allocation is the existing 4KiB preload buffer, which is
released immediately after the copy completes or fails.
