## Directory Structure
* lib/: Internal libraries (Epub engine, GfxRenderer, UITheme, I18n)
  * lib/hal/: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HalDisplay, HalGPIO, HalStorage)
  * lib/I18n/: Internationalization (translations in `translations/*.yaml`, generated string tables)
* src/activities/: UI logic using the Activity Lifecycle (onEnter, loop, onExit)
* freeink-sdk/: Low-level SDK (FreeInkDisplay, InputManager, BatteryMonitor, SDCardManager)
* .crosspoint/: SD-based binary cache for EPUB metadata and pre-rendered layout sections

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

**CRITICAL**: Always use HAL classes, NOT SDK classes directly.

| HAL Class | Wraps SDK Class | Purpose | Singleton Macro |
|-----------|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| `HalDisplay` | `EInkDisplay` | E-ink display control | *(none)* |
| `HalGPIO` | `InputManager` | Button input handling | *(none)* |
| `HalStorage` | `SDCardManager` | SD card file I/O | `Storage` |

**Location**: [lib/hal/](../../lib/hal/)

**Why HAL?**
- Provides consistent error logging per module
- Abstracts SDK implementation details
- Centralizes resource management

**Example - HalStorage**:
```cpp
#include <HalStorage.h>

// Use Storage singleton (defined via macro)
HalFile file;
if (Storage.openFileForRead("MODULE", "/path/to/file.bin", file)) {
  // Read from file
  // No file.close() needed — DESTRUCTOR_CLOSES_FILE=1 handles it at scope exit
}
```

**Usage**: Use `HalFile` (the mutex-wrapping handle), NOT raw SdFat `FsFile` or Arduino `File`. Do NOT add `file.close()` for local variables (see [build-system.md](build-system.md) → DESTRUCTOR_CLOSES_FILE).

**SdFat is not thread-safe; all SD access MUST go through HalStorage**:
- SdFat's `SdSpiCard` tracks SPI bus state with an unsynchronized `m_spiActive` bool. Two tasks calling SdFat concurrently can confuse that state machine and end with one task calling `SPIClass::endTransaction()` against a paramLock the *other* task is holding. That trips FreeRTOS's `xTaskPriorityDisinherit` assert (`tasks.c:5156, pxTCB == pxCurrentTCBs[0]`) and panics the system. See SdFat issue #518.
- `HalStorage` serializes everything via `storageMutex`. Downstream code uses `HalFile` (declared in `<HalStorage.h>`); every method call (read, write, seek, close) takes the mutex. `HalFile`'s destructor also takes the mutex before letting the underlying SdFat `FsFile` close.
- **Never** call into `SdFat` / `SdSpiCard` / `FsBaseFile` / `SDCardManager` / raw `FsFile` directly — that bypasses the mutex.

**CPU frequency changes must go through `HalPowerManager::setPowerSaving()`**:
- `modeMutex` protects the target-mode decision, the entire `setCpuFrequencyMhz()` call, and the `isLowPower` update. Update state only after a successful transition; repeated requests for the current state do nothing.
- Arduino's APB callbacks hold SPI locks between the BEFORE and AFTER callbacks. Concurrent frequency changes can deadlock: one task holds a SPI lock while waiting for the APB callback lock, and another holds the APB callback lock while waiting for that SPI lock. Serializing only the state assignment is insufficient.
- `HalPowerManager::Lock` sets `NormalSpeed` under `modeMutex`, then releases the mutex **before** calling `setPowerSaving(false)`. Keep that ordering: the mutex is not recursive. Obtain the power lock before starting SPI work. The existing helper supports only one active power lock; it is not a nested-lock counter.
- Preserve the Wi-Fi/C3 BLE host guards and board-specific frequency restrictions. Light sleep and CPU downclocking are separate decisions; fixing clock serialization must not disable either Bluetooth or standby light sleep.

`Storage.getSpace(totalBytes, freeBytes)` queries filesystem data capacity, not
raw card size, through the SDK's unified capacity query under the same mutex.
Both outputs are zero on failure; callers must check the boolean result before
using them. The SDK derives cluster bytes from 512-byte sectors with 64-bit
arithmetic because SdFat 2.3.1's FAT `bytesPerCluster()` truncates 64 KiB to zero.
Successful free-space scans are cached for 20 seconds from completion; failures
invalidate the cache and are retried on the next query. Mount/unmount resets it.
The cache is a snapshot, not an immediate accounting of subsequent writes.
The About page paints its loading state before this synchronous query; input
waits for the scan to finish. Host simulator capacity comes from `statvfs`, so
use `python3 scripts/tests/test_sd_space.py` for FAT calculation regressions.

## Common Patterns

### Singleton Access
**Available Singletons**:
```cpp
#define SETTINGS CrossPointSettings::getInstance()  // User settings
#define APP_STATE CrossPointState::getInstance()    // Runtime state
#define GUI UITheme::getInstance()                   // Current theme
#define Storage HalStorage::getInstance()            // SD card I/O
#define I18N I18n::getInstance()                     // Internationalization
```

### Activity Lifecycle and Memory Management

**Source**: [src/main.cpp:132-143](../../src/main.cpp)

**CRITICAL**: Activities are **heap-allocated** and **deleted on exit**.

```cpp
// main.cpp navigation pattern
void exitActivity() {
  if (currentActivity) {
    currentActivity->onExit();
    delete currentActivity;  // Activity deleted here!
    currentActivity = nullptr;
  }
}

void enterNewActivity(Activity* activity) {
  currentActivity = activity;  // Heap-allocated activity
  currentActivity->onEnter();
}
```

**Memory Implications**:
- Activity navigation = `delete` old activity + `new` create next activity
- Any memory allocated in `onEnter()` MUST be freed in `onExit()`
- FreeRTOS tasks MUST be deleted in `onExit()` before activity destruction
- Member `FsFile` handles MUST be closed in `onExit()` (local `FsFile` variables auto-close via destructor)
- `ActivityManager` calls `onExit()` while already holding `RenderLock`; never acquire a second render lock there

**Activity Pattern**:
```cpp
void onEnter()  { Activity::onEnter(); /* alloc: buffer, tasks */ render(); }
void loop()     { /* read the mappedInput snapshot; handle input */ }
void onExit()   { /* free: vTaskDelete, free buffer, close member FsFiles */ Activity::onExit(); }
```

The main loop updates mapped input once per frame before
`ActivityManager::loop()`. Normal Activities must not update it again.

**Critical**: Free resources in reverse order. Delete tasks BEFORE activity destruction.

### FreeRTOS Task Guidelines

**Source**: [src/activities/util/KeyboardEntryActivity.cpp:45-50](../../src/activities/util/KeyboardEntryActivity.cpp)

**Pattern**: See Activity Lifecycle above. `xTaskCreate(&taskTrampoline, "Name", stackSize, this, 1, &handle)`

**Stack Sizing** (in BYTES, not words):
- **2048**: Simple rendering (most activities)
- **4096**: Network, EPUB parsing
- Monitor: `uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark()` if crashes

**Rules**: Always `vTaskDelete()` in `onExit()` before destruction. Use mutex if shared state.

### Global Font Loading

**Source**: [src/main.cpp:40-115](../../src/main.cpp)

**Built-in fonts are global static objects** at firmware startup:
- International UI fonts: 8, 10, 12pt
- Simplified-Chinese UI fallbacks: 8, 10, 12pt
- Offline reader fallback: 12pt; other sizes and styles use SD `.cpfont`

OpenDyslexic and the broad Noto reader families live in the SD font catalog
(`lib/EpdFont/scripts/sd-fonts.yaml`). Legacy IDs resolve to the 12pt fallback.

**Compilation Flag**:
```cpp
#ifndef OMIT_FONTS
  // Most fonts loaded here
#endif
```

**Implications**:
- Fonts stored in **Flash** (marked as `static const` in `lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/`)
- Font rendering data cached in **DRAM** when first used
- `OMIT_FONTS` can reduce binary size for minimal builds
- Font IDs defined in [src/fontIds.h](../../src/fontIds.h)

**Usage**:
```cpp
#include "fontIds.h"

renderer.insertFont(FONT_UI_MEDIUM, ui12FontFamily);
renderer.drawText(FONT_UI_MEDIUM, x, y, "Hello", true);
```
