# Unified Firmware Chinese Support

> Deep reference for [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md): runtime content profiles,
> the compact embedded CJK fallback, and CJK font regeneration.

Every hardware target now builds one firmware. The base environment always
enables the existing CJK code paths. Selecting `Language::ZH_CN` uses
`ContentProfile::China`; every other language uses `ContentProfile::Global`.
The startup guide and later UI-language changes apply the same rule.

| Resource | Unified behavior |
|---|---|
| i18n | `gen_i18n.py` always emits all 33 languages. |
| UI fonts | International 8/10/12pt faces are primary; Simplified-Chinese 8/10/12pt subsets are registered through `setFallbackFont()`. |
| Reader fonts | Only the 12pt CJK subset is an offline fallback. Complete families and other sizes use the existing `.cpfont` download/SD loader, one reader size resident at a time. |
| EPUB/TXT | Unicode CJK parsing, line breaking and missing-glyph detection are always compiled and trigger from text content. |
| Regional apps | WeRead and Chinese Chess are compiled once and exposed only for the China content profile. |
| Services | China uses `crossmux.cn`, OTA variant `cn`, and China NTP servers; Global uses `crossmux.com`, variant `global`, and international NTP servers. Initial onboarding alone sets the default UTC offset. |

**Flash budget** (default `partitions.csv`, dual A/B app slot = 6.25 MB):

| Build (2026-08-27) | Flash | Slot headroom | Static RAM |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `gh_release` unified C3 | 5,828,005 B | 725,595 B | 55,604 B |

A/B OTA remains unchanged: both app slots are 6,553,600 bytes. Release builds
must stay at or below 6,029,312 bytes to retain at least 512 KiB headroom.

> **Historical note (2026-05-19)**: the committed `notosans_cjk_*.h` headers

> **Update (2026-05-26)**: 14pt was promoted to the 7000 通用汉字 tier with

> **Update (2026-07-24)**: 14pt returned to the common tier and the extended

The unified build keeps LTO disabled. Combining LTO with the custom ESP-IDF core
rebuild previously allowed cache-critical SPI flash helpers to be linked into
Flash; calling them while cache was disabled caused an early-boot Cache Error.
Do not re-enable LTO without checking the final ELF and map for the affected
IRAM mappings.

The active size strategy is to embed only 8/10/12pt CJK subsets and externalize
large reading faces to `.cpfont`. This removes flash data without introducing a
decompression buffer or a new long-lived heap allocation.

## WeRead transport

The root headers below `src/activities/apps/weread/` are compile-time-only
selection points. The public build uses the UI in `webapi/` with
`lib/WeReadWebApi`; there is no runtime backend switch.

WeRead owns its transport in `lib/WeReadWebApi/src/WeReadHttpClient.*`;
the public `HttpDownloader` has no WeRead-specific session, Cookie, or protocol
logic. On device, the client uses wolfSSL through `freeink::SecureClient`, a
caller-owned 4 KB work buffer, and one best-effort persistent connection.
Chapter images are streamed to SD and scheduled in batches by HTTPS host, so
requests for the same host reuse that single connection. Redirects may change
the active host, but only `weread.qq.com` and its subdomains receive the WeRead
Cookie. The connection closes before EPUB packaging, and also closes early
when free heap falls below 20 KB or the largest block falls below 8 KB.

The pinned SDK owns the maximum-fragment request: `HAVE_MAX_FRAGMENT` remains
enabled and `SecureClient` requests 2 KiB before the handshake. There is no
application SNI wrapper. This preserves the effective request on the original
SDK path; it does not prove that the peer accepted it. HTTP buffer sizes do not
establish TLS record sizes. Cipher suites and hardware acceleration are unchanged.

Chapter shard merging and Base64 input reuse the Operation's 4 KiB buffer instead
of allocating a temporary 1 KiB buffer per chapter; Base64 output writes remain
unchanged. Downloads remain serial on C3 and S3. UI stage numbers and labels share
one mapping and drawing path; chapter progress refresh requests use 5% buckets,
while images retain 10% buckets. Unknown totals show waiting text rather than a
percentage. DEBUG-only diagnostic sampling is compiled out at lower log levels.
Timing includes synchronous SD I/O and must not be interpreted as pure CPU work.
See the [WeRead README](../../src/activities/apps/weread/README.md) for measurement
boundaries, cold-cache test records, and unverified hardware checks.

Device requests call `setInsecure()`: traffic is encrypted, but the CA and host
identity are not verified. This makes session credentials and downloaded
content vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attacker. The native simulator takes
a different path, `WeReadHttpClient -> simulator esp_http_client shim -> curl`,
and uses the host trust store for certificate verification. WeRead uses an
unofficial Web protocol and may stop working when the service changes.

## WeRead progress sync

The reader exposes one **Sync Progress** menu action. When the current EPUB path
exactly matches a standard book in `shelf.bin`, the action uses WeRead; all other
EPUBs continue to use KOReader. WeRead public-account books (`MP_WXS_`), moved
files, and renamed files are intentionally treated as ordinary EPUBs. The
existing long-press KOReader shortcut is unchanged.

Manual WeRead sync starts with the saved Cookie and renews it only after an
authentication failure. Newly generated WeRead chapters retain invisible
raw-XHTML UTF-16 source anchors. These map the local page's visible-text offset
to WeRead's native `chapterUid + chapterOffset` coordinate without clamping the
offset to the `WRT2` word count; the inverse mapping restores a remote offset
through the reader's existing pagination LUT. Older generated books without
anchors retain the visible-offset approximation, and other EPUBs fall back to
the whole-book percentage derived from `WRT2` word counts. Different canonical
positions show the direction selector. A local upload uses an enter/report pair
and includes the whole seconds recorded by the local reading session that ended
when manual sync was opened. When the remote position is selected, its exact
chapter and offset are reported before being applied locally, so reporting time
cannot move cloud progress backwards. Upload is accepted only after a read-back
verifies the chapter and offset. A timed report is not automatically repeated
after an ambiguous network failure; the current sync screen retains it for an
explicit Retry, but no pending time is persisted after leaving the screen. An
expired session directs the user back to **Apps → WeRead** to sign in; it does
not open a QR flow from the reader.

For a new standard-book cache, the downloader fetches cloud progress after the
`WRT2` catalog and before any chapter or image. This request is best effort:
network, authentication, and protocol failures are logged but do not block the
book download. After the EPUB is atomically replaced, a successful result is
stored as the one-shot `WRP1` initial position. The reader consumes it only when
there is no valid local `progress.bin`; an existing local position always wins.
Public-account books skip this prefetch. See [file-formats.md](../file-formats.md)
for the `WRT2` and `WRP1` layouts and migration rules.

## Regenerating the CJK fonts

```bash
# 1. (One-time) install build deps into a venv
python3 -m venv /tmp/cn_font_venv
/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/pip install -r lib/EpdFont/scripts/requirements.txt

# 2. Place the official Noto Sans CJK SC Regular OTF into the source dir
#    (gitignored) under the filename expected by the script.
#    Source:
#    https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk/blob/main/Sans/OTF/SimplifiedChinese/NotoSansCJKsc-Regular.otf
cp /path/to/NotoSansSC-Regular.otf lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/source/NotoSansSC/

# 3. (Optional) regenerate the character lists. build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh
#    calls this for you in Step 0 unless SKIP_CHARSET=1 is set.
#    Writes BOTH cn_common_chars.txt (top-N + require-from) and
#    cn_i18n_chars.txt (require-from only — drives the 14/16/18pt subset).
PYTHON=/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/python3 \
  python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/build_cn_charset.py \
    --require-from lib/I18n/translations/chinese.yaml

# 4. Generate the 6 per-size CJK headers
PYTHON=/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/python3 \
  bash lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh

# 5. Build the unified C3 firmware
pio run -e gh_release

# Build all six unified ESP32-S3 device binaries
pio run -e sticky -e x4pro -e papermono -e eego_a4 \
  -e murphy_m4 -e waveshare_epaper_397
```

Nightly builds and stores one neutrally named binary set per hardware target.
The legacy `global` and `zh-CN` schema-v1 manifests both reference that set;
publishing rejects a pair whose asset names, sizes, or SHA-256 values differ.
See [firmware-release.md](firmware-release.md) for the release and index contract.

The committed headers were regenerated with source SHA-256
`2c76254f6fc379fddfce0a7e84fb5385bb135d3e399294f6eeb6680d0365b74b`.
Verify a replacement source before regeneration: on the current committed
charset it must reproduce the existing glyph metrics and bitmap bytes. The
subset step deliberately excludes zero-width compatibility code point U+FFA0,
which is present in the official OTF but was absent from the previous source.

`build_cn_charset.py --top N` means "keep the top N characters from the base
pool, then add every required character." Required glyphs never displace base
glyphs, so output can contain more than N characters. `--top` may equal the
pool size but may not exceed it. The script rereads both generated files and
fails if a selected base or required character is missing.

## Force-including feature-specific glyphs

Each feature that needs CJK glyphs not already covered by the natural source
for the point size where it renders (the 3500-char pool at 8–12pt, or
`chinese.yaml` at 14/16/18pt) ships a small dedicated text file and adds it to
the `REQUIRE_FROM` array in
[build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh](../../lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh).
`build_cn_charset.py --require-from <file>` regex-scans the complete file for
every CJK Unified Ideograph (`[一-鿿]`) and force-includes them in **both**
`cn_common_chars.txt` (8/10/12pt) and `cn_i18n_chars.txt` (14/16/18pt), so
glyphs added via this mechanism render at every CN font size.

Current example: [cn_almanac_chars.txt](../../lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_almanac_chars.txt)
holds the extra chars `ChineseAlmanac.cpp` / `ChineseCalendarFace.cpp` need
for its ≤14pt rows and 18pt lunar row:

```text
戊庚壬癸寅卯巳酉戌廿蛰闰初七八九十冬腊
```

Pattern when adding a new feature:

1. Create `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_<feature>_chars.txt` containing only the
   CJK chars the feature renders that aren't otherwise covered (one line,
   UTF-8, no separators required).
2. Append that path to `REQUIRE_FROM=(... cn_<feature>_chars.txt)` in
   `build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh`.
3. Re-run `bash build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh` and commit the regenerated
   `cn_common_chars.txt`, `cn_i18n_chars.txt`, and six `notosans_cjk_*.h`.

Anti-pattern (don't do this): hiding chars in a `#` YAML comment inside
`chinese.yaml` to abuse the regex scanner. It works (build_cn_charset.py
does scan comments) but couples a font detail to the i18n file's structure
and forces `gen_i18n.py` to know about it. Dedicated `cn_*_chars.txt`
files are self-documenting and orthogonal to i18n.

## Expanding character coverage

`--top` is capped by the source pool size (`chars_3500_common.txt` has 3500
chars by construction — it is the vendored 教育部《现代汉语常用字表》).
Passing `--top 3500` keeps the complete pool; passing `--top 5000` fails.

To enlarge the renderable character set:

1. **For a handful of specific chars**: add a feature-scoped
   `cn_<feature>_chars.txt` as described above. One-line file + one-line
   append to `REQUIRE_FROM`. No pool expansion needed.
2. **For broad coverage gain** (e.g. classical literature, GB2312 Lv2): drop a
   larger source list into `lib/EpdFont/scripts/` (e.g. a `gb2312_full.txt`
   union of Lv1+Lv2) and point `SOURCE_FILE` in `build_cn_charset.py` at it.
   This is a deliberate Flash-budget decision — every 1000 extra chars adds
   roughly **380 KB** to the 8/10/12pt headers combined.

The hard ceiling is the 6.25 MiB A/B-OTA slot; the release gate reserves at
least 512 KiB, so broad pool expansion must be measured in the built image.

## Complete Chinese SD fonts

The unified firmware chooses the catalog host from the language-selected content profile:

```text
https://crossmux.cn/api/assets/fonts/m<manifest>-b<binary>/fonts.json
https://crossmux.com/api/assets/fonts/m<manifest>-b<binary>/fonts.json
```

Both catalogs are reached through CrossMux; firmware no longer selects GitHub
or Gitee directly. The returned manifest still supplies immutable asset URLs.

The version numbers come from the firmware's manifest and cpfont constants.
All catalogs must keep manifest v1 and referenced cpfont v4 assets consistent.
`baseUrl`, family/file names, non-zero file sizes, and CRC32 values must be
valid; the external catalog maintainer is responsible for complete Chinese
coverage.

The firmware offers the guided downloader when a built-in font is changed to
14/16/18pt, or when an EPUB scan sees a missing U+4E00–U+9FFF or
U+F900–U+FAFF glyph. The render task only records the first codepoint; the main
loop opens the activity. A reader session prompts once, and an active SD font
is never rechecked. The Text Settings prompt retains the ordinary **Manage
Fonts** flow. The EPUB prompt instead downloads and verifies the complete
`NotoSansSC` family, rejects a catalog without the exact current point size,
selects it without changing the point size, and silently restarts before loading
it. The clean boot supplies the contiguous heap required by the complete CJK
interval table, then runs the existing Flash preprocessing path and returns to
the same book and visible-text offset. Back and cancellation return there without
changing the selection; Home still routes to Home. Download and clean-boot load
errors remain on a Retry/Back page. A preprocessing failure keeps the verified
family, disables Flash preload, shows one notice, and continues from SD.

The manual manager still allows install/update/delete and batch downloads. A
single download selects that family and opens the text preview; **Download
All** prefers stable `NotoSansSC`, while **Update All** preserves the current
selection. In ordinary Text Settings entry, layout/style-only changes and font
changes later restored to their entry values skip preprocessing.

When `NotoSansSC` is discovered through download, web upload, or an SD-card
copy, it replaces the active built-in face and the built-in row is hidden. If
the family disappears, the existing missing-font fallback clears the SD
selection and the single built-in Noto Sans row becomes visible again. Legacy
Chinese settings that selected the duplicate built-in Serif ID migrate to the
Sans ID. Font sources and catalog-generation configuration remain outside this
repository.

## Known limitations

- **No bold/italic CJK glyphs**: the bitmaps come from a single NotoSansSC-Regular subset. The Settings page gives its four top-level Chinese category labels a fixed one-pixel synthetic bold; other UI elements that pass `EpdFontFamily::Style::Bold` render the regular weight under CN.
- **Offline reader fallback is 12pt only**: install an SD `.cpfont` family for other reading sizes and styles. The INX Settings categories also remain at the theme-defined 12pt because the unified firmware has no resident 16pt CJK UI face.
- **Rare characters render as □ in reader at SMALL until an SD font is installed**: the 12pt bitmap uses the complete 3500-char pool plus required glyphs. It omits classical/scientific rarities, Traditional Chinese variants, and uncommon names outside that set; for example, `璟` is intentionally absent. The reader offers the complete-font downloader on the first detected missing glyph.
- **No Traditional Chinese UI locale**: only `ZH_CN` is present; broader CJK book coverage depends on the selected SD font.

## Files

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/build_cn_charset.py` | Rank the base pool by wordfreq Zipf, preserve its top-N, then add all required glyphs. Pool capped at `chars_3500_common.txt` size (3500). |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/chars_3500_common.txt` | Source pool — 现代汉语常用字表, 3500 chars (committed). To expand coverage, swap this file (see "Expanding character coverage"). |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_common_chars.txt` | Generated common subset, drives 8/10/12pt (committed). Contains all 3500 base chars plus required additions; currently 3517 unique CJK chars. |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_i18n_chars.txt` | Generated i18n-only subset, drives 14/16/18pt (committed). Contains every CJK char found in `--require-from` inputs. |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh` | pyftsubset → fontconvert.py pipeline, six headers. Default re-runs `build_cn_charset.py`; set `SKIP_CHARSET=1` to reuse the current `cn_common_chars.txt`. The `REQUIRE_FROM=(...)` array at the top lists every file scanned for force-included CJK chars — add new feature-scoped `cn_*_chars.txt` files here. |
| `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_almanac_chars.txt` | Feature-scoped force-include for `ChineseAlmanac.cpp` / `ChineseCalendarFace.cpp` — ganzhi stems/branches missing from the common tier plus lunar-row vocabulary missing from the i18n tier. Single-line UTF-8. |
| `lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/notosans_cjk_{8,10,12,14,16,18}.h` | Generated raw 2-bit bitmap headers (committed). Must match `cn_common_chars.txt` (8/10/12pt) and `cn_i18n_chars.txt` (14/16/18pt) — see consistency check below. |
| `lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/source/NotoSansSC/` | OTF source dir (gitignored except for `.gitignore`). Drop `NotoSansSC-Regular.otf` here. |
| `lib/I18n/translations/chinese.yaml` | Simplified Chinese translations (`_language_code: ZH_CN`); also fed to `--require-from` so every CJK char in `STR_*: "value"` lines is forced into both subsets. Do **not** hide font-only chars in `#` comments — use a `cn_<feature>_chars.txt` file instead. |

## Consistency check

After regenerating, confirm the character lists and bitmap headers match:

- `cn_common_chars.txt` has 3517 unique CJK glyphs and contains the complete
  3500-char base pool.
- `cn_i18n_chars.txt` has 747 unique CJK glyphs and contains every glyph
  scanned from `chinese.yaml` and feature-specific files.
- 8/10/12pt each contain 4014 glyphs; 14/16/18pt each contain 1244 glyphs.
- Every generated header says `mode: 2-bit`.

steps before committing.
